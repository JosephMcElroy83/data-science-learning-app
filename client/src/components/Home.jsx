        What is Data Science
      </h1>
        
      <p>Most people believe that data science is a field of study that just reviews numbers and calculations. This may be true, however the focus on data science is hypothesis testing and writing. What problems can you see and what can be done about it? This is a life long question through the scientific processes. With this in mind, if you saw a set of data and were asked to write a hypothesis on the spot, what would draw your eye first? Keep this in mind when you move forward to the data page. It is important to pick a start point and revise yourself after, just like using the scientific method. Data Science is always asking more of question formulating and then evaluating if those questions make sense within the context. </p>
